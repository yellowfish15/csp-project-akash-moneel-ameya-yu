## Sandbox Gravity Simulation - 
### Controls:
- 'Right Click' to add a new fixed object into the simulation

- 'Left Click' to add a new non-fixed object into the simulation

- While 'Left Click' is activated
  - Drag mouse away from object to increase initial velocity
  - Press 'up' or 'down' arrow keys to increment or decrement object mass respectively

See Documentation in Gravity2D directory for additional details.

## 2D Solar System Model -
2D visual of Solar System with model gravity mechanics.

## 3D Solar System Model -
- 3D visual of Solar System with model gravity mechanics.

- Player uses mouse and w-a-s-d keys to manipulate 3D space to explore parts of the solar system
  - WASD keys move along the current x-y plane, the mouse can be used to tilt up and down to adjust movement in 3D space
  - Uses library QueasyCam to run, need to import manually on a user by user basis

- Gravity mechanics are in motion when player is exploring

- Simulation is in quick-time

-Simulation reference objects are scaled for maximum user experience. Otherwise, the central Sun would be too large and the rest would be too small

-The planets in relation to each other are more accurate in this regard
